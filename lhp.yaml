#   - "!**/temp_*.yaml"           # Exclude temporary files (prefix with !) 


## Optional: Add operational metadata columns to the generated pipelines
## These can be used to track the source of the data and the processing of the data
operational_metadata:
  columns:
  
    _source_file_path:
      expression: "F.col('_metadata.file_path')"
      description: "File paths"
      applies_to: ["view"]
    
    _processing_timestamp:
      expression: "F.current_timestamp()"
      description: "When the record was processed by the pipeline"
      applies_to: ["streaming_table", "materialized_view", "view"]

    _source_file_name:
      expression: "F.col('_metadata.file_name')"
      description: "Name of the input file along with its extension"
      applies_to: ["view"]
